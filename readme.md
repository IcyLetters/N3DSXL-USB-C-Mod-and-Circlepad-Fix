## Overview

So essentially this can be broken down into two guides. One on adding a USB-C port to your New 3DS XL and another on recovering a broken circlepad if things go wrong. If you just need to fix your circlepad, you can skip ahead to the troubleshooting section.

## Tools Needed
 - Soldering Iron (preferrably temp controlled but this is a rather simple mod so any will work)  
 - Wire (Black and red preferrably but any will work, I would recommend anything above 22 gauge, the smaller the better)  
 - USB-C Breakout Board (Sparkfun sells these otherwise Amazon does work, Amazon sells $4 on prime: https://a.co/d/fOM2OCB)
 - Fine files, and preferrably a rotary tool. The file is essential, rotary tool is recommended for starting.

## Making room

This is the most tedious process of the entire mod, it will take roughly half an hour to an hour depending. This is also the most important part cosmetically, if you mess up here there is no fixing it. So make sure you proceed carefully and have patience.
